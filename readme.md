The only exercise rn is presents, its a copy of the AOC exercise i did a long time ago but im low on time and ideas.
click the green code button and download a zip with the files
read the readme of presents, download sizes.txt and solutionchecker.py
You can open solutionchecker.py in the terminal to avoid seeing the answer,
it will check if your solution is correct
After you finish the task you can move onto the plottwist exercise
