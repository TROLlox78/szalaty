Szalaty hello,
Hitler writing, I want to give gifts to jews for Easter this year,
I decided that I'm going to wrap all the gifts in paper but
I don't know how much wrapping paper I need to buy. 

I'd like you to calculate how many square units of wrapping paper
I need to buy for the presents. I know the dimensions of the boxes
I'll be wrapping -i'm sending them over in the sizes.txt file.
All I need you to do is calculate the area of each box
for example a 5x5x4 coffin..I mean box requires 130units square


if you'd like to try a solution download solutionchecker and open it in the terminal,
you can verify the answer there, dont open the file or you'll see the solution
